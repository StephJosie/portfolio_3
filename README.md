# <Portfolio>
## Description
I created a working portfolio.  I will be able to add to my portfolio as I learn throughout the class.  I am looking forward to adding on to what I currently have done.  Currently do not have any of my own personal work and look forwaard to adding my own projects.

## Usage
This will oneday be used to help with job hunting.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
